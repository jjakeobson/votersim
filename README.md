VOTER SIMULATOR
-------------------
Voter Sim
Voter Simulation Project Wyncode Week 2
Create a REPL-driven voting simulation program.

Overview
A user should be able to create politicians and voters, then run an election simulation. Each voter votes for one politician according to the politician’s political party and the voter’s politicial affiliation.

Once all the characters in the simulation are in place, run an election by allowing each voter to cast a vote. Then tally all the votes and declare a winner.

This is a very large project, but it would be significantly more complex to solve without OOP. This is a great opportunity to recognize the value OOP.

Tip! Tests and TDD may help you manage the complexity of this large project.

Important! Read through this entire document! Especially take advantage of the Getting Started section after the project description.
